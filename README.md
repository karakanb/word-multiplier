# Word Multiplier
This is a basic script that takes inputs from three different word groups, and then it generates different combinations of those words. 

For example, if the groups are like this: `Star`, `Trek, Wars`, `I,II,III`

and the result will be: `Star Trek I, Star Wars I, Star Trek II, Star Wars II, Star Trek III, Star Wars III`.

This script returns a string of generated words line by line. A live example can be seen at `keywordmultiplier.net`.

Have fun!
